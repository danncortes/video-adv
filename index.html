    <br>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Picture this: You ask a coworker about their weekend and wind up hearing about
        how they won a break dancing competition, broke a triathlon record, or built a robo-car. And then they ask what
        you did and your answer goes something like, “Well, Hulu had to check on me because I binge-watched too many
        episodes of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Good Place</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”
      </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or what about the meetings when everyone’s asked to introduce themselves, but
        you know, in the low pressure, “say something interesting about yourself” kind of way? For me, these
        introductions send my heart into palpitations—reverberating through my body with force. Sound familiar? Just
        me? </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serving up a mildly interesting anecdote should be easy enough, but as my highly
        talented coworkers—like say a published polyglot with a pilot’s license—introduce themselves, I start feeling
        anxious. The question, while intended to illuminate commonalities, can feel like a measure of worthiness. Am I
        in the right room?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You see, I’m a Type B Product Content Strategist at Airbnb. I’m on a team of
        designers, engineers, product managers, data scientists, and many more who design, build, and maintain our
        payments platform. Like most Type Bs, I’m easy going and adaptable. Type As, on the other hand, are ambitious
        and efficient. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, it feels like everyone around me is Type A. Yet when I confess to
        colleagues that I’m a secret Type B living in a seemingly Type A world, many respond with knowing nods and
        conspiratorial whispers of “I feel the same way!” Opening up about feeling like the odd one out has paved the
        way for me to find fellow Type Bs, and to uncover the unique strengths each type brings to the table. </span></p>
    <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Are These Types, Again?</span></h2>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s back up a bit. The Type A and Type B personality theory was developed by</span><a
        href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/personality-a.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Friedman &amp;
          Rosenman</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;back in 1976. They characterized Type As as
        consistent high-achievers, lovers of competition, and very deadline-motivated. Visualize the quintessential
        workaholic—that’s Type A. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, Type Bs were identified as tolerant of ideas and people, laid-back
        about most things, and avoidant of stress. Think The Dude from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The
          Big Lebowski</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That’s Type B. Most of us are a mishmash of these
        types depending on the context, but they’re pretty useful as high-level generalizations.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airbnb is seemingly brimming with Type A go-getters. And while I’m inspired by
        all these passionate, talented individuals, it can sometimes make this B Type feel like a grade A imposter.
        Although I assume my relaxed approach is a weakness, the truth is Type Bs have unique strengths, too. And as it
        turns out, there’s a lot more of us at Airbnb than I thought.</span></p>
    <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">It Takes All Kinds</span></h3>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collaboration between both types results in innovative approaches to
        problem-solving that can take our work to unexpected places and extraordinary outcomes. To prove it, here are
        some common workplace scenarios where each type shines in complementary ways.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><b>1. Meetings</b></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airbnb has a very meeting-friendly culture. Eight hours of overlapping,
        back-to-back meetings is the norm. At the beginning of a meeting, while I’m chatting with a coworker about that
        page-turner they’re reading, the Type As are busy taking charge and keeping everyone</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,
      </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">including me</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on
        task. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meetings get a bad rap because they can cannibalize time that could be spent
        creating, but when your team includes Type As, meetings are much more productive. These folks will produce
        detailed agendas, specify meeting goals, and articulate deliverables for every stakeholder. Their assertive
        nature allows them to passionately defend their position and inspire the team to question assumptions and find
        solutions as a group. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Type Bs, on the other hand, tend to hang back in the meetings, which is
        beneficial when it’s 6pm on a Friday and the conversation is going in circles. As big-picture thinkers, we
        don’t get bogged down by minutiae. We’re not always the most detail-oriented, but Type Bs will help drive the
        conversation forward by rallying the team around a common vision. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We crave consensus, so if there’s any tension, we’ll bring a little levity by
        acknowledging all the great points everyone has made or by telling a joke to keep everyone’s spirits up. At the
        very least, we’ll recommend that this particular sticking point be revisited on Monday. </span></p>
    <p><b>2. Iterating</b></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone at Airbnb is passionate about delivering the best experience to our
        guests and hosts. Let’s say we’re redesigning guest checkout. We’ll begin by auditing the current experience,
        producing a competitor analysis, holding research sessions, and then we’ll start design and content
        explorations.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Type As are the teammates who’ll obsess over every detail. They’ll know the
        research inside and out, they’ll weave the insights into their designs, they’ll think through all those tricky
        edge cases, and they’ll have elegant solutions to the thorniest problems. These exacting standards mean their
        work tends to be high on quality and fidelity. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Type Bs will help everyone keep things in perspective. When our colleagues are
        obsessing over every pixel, we’ll cheer them on with affirmations of, “That looks great!” The pursuit of
        perfection can stall progress, so we’ll champion testing as a playground for iteration. We’ll focus on getting
        a concept in market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">or at least
        in user testing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and refine based
        on how guests interact with our product. </span></p>
    <p><b>3. Deadlines</b></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Payments platform supports just about every team at Airbnb. We work with
        partners across the organization to build solutions and integrations that allow them to meet their goals. The
        payments world is also highly regulated, so we spend a lot of time updating the platform to comply with new
        regulations. As a result, our projects tend to have tight deadlines. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When deadlines loom, Type As jump into action. With their keen attention to
        detail, they’re able to quickly diagnose cross-functional needs, identify all the dependencies, and choose a
        course of action that ensures a quality outcome. Their high standards motivate the team to raise the bar and
        think blue sky. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Type Bs are the voice of reason. We strive to find a balance
        between ROI and level of effort. We’ll champion the MVP (minimum viable product) to ensure we get everything
        done on time. When the stress levels start to rise, we’ll help the team relax a bit. </span></p>
    <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better Together</span></h3>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best workplaces include Type As, Type Bs, and everything in between. But
        there’s a myth that to be successful in tech, you need to be Type A. Every article I’ve read about founders and
        visionaries seems to document in excruciating detail how they sleep three hours a night, dial in to meetings
        from the shower (don’t worry, they turn the camera off), and get all their nutrients from liquid supplements
        (because who has time for solid food?). Just reading about these lifestyles leaves me exhausted. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Type As are portrayed as the prototype of success, a lot of leaders
        show signs of being Type B. Take Google CEO Sundar Pichai’s relaxed </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9bkQ_U7dPU"><span
          style="font-weight: 400;">morning routine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example. He wakes
        up and reads the paper, eats an omelette and toast with a cup of tea, and takes time to do some big-picture
        thinking. Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh intentionally </span><a href="https://www.virgin.com/disruptors/what-employee-wellbeing-means-me-tony-hsieh"><span
          style="font-weight: 400;">emphasizes employee wellbeing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and
        fosters a culture of friendship.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, the trope that Type As are natural leaders and Type Bs are lighthearted
        slackers just isn’t true. There’s more than one way to lead or contribute to a team—it’s all about finding what
        works for you. Similarly, it’s important to shift our internal narrative about perceived weakness.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Me? I’m not great at data analytics. Knowing that pulling and interpreting data
        is one of my skill gaps encourages me to get better at SQL queries. But it’s just as important for me recognize
        that as a big-picture thinker, I excel at helping data scientists tell compelling stories through insights.
      </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By focusing on how our abilities dovetail, we can carve out spaces that
        celebrate our unique talents. Type As will galvanize their team to care about the details, while Type Bs will
        be a reassuring and calming presence. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll admit that working with such ambitious, driven, and wildly talented people
        used to be a little intimidating. But in the same way that I’ve embraced the benefits of being Type B, I’ve
        decided not to worry about being interesting. So ask me how I spent my weekend. I probably didn’t climb a
        mountain or teach myself Arduino, and I’m totally okay with that. </span></p>
